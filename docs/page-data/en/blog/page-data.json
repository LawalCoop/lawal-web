We are part of the Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS) movement, and sectorally, our work in the tech industry connects us to FACTTIC, the Argentine Federation of Worker Cooperatives in Technology, Innovation, and Knowledge. We are more than 40 grouped cooperatives, a space of construction that has been generating job opportunities, social projects, and mutual aid for over 10 years. ","culture_internacional.content_line2":"We see ourselves as territorial social actors, which is why those of us at Lawal are also involved in other social projects in Villa La Angostura. That’s how we support the development of Mutual La Correntosa, based on the organization of neighbors concerned with food sovereignty and dedicated to strengthening ties between consumers and family or cooperative agriculture producers. ","culture_internacional.content_line3":"Additionally, with an interest in Patagonia’s history—from its ancestral roots to the meanings we construct today—as well as in sustaining community cultural spaces, we connect with the Osvaldo Bayer Popular Library and participate in joint projects like Archivos del Sur. ","labs.title":"Experimental ","labs.subtitle":"At Lawal, we choose to use technology as a tool to explore our territory and our minds.

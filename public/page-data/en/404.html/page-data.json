Those of us who made this happen come from years of diverse cooperative experiences, particularly in software development, and this shared knowledge gave us confidence in the potential of collaborative and self-managed structures. ","culture_historia.content_line2":"Lawal (or lahual) is the name given by the Mapuche-Huilliche people to the larch tree (Fitzroya cupressoides). Its meaning in the Mapudungun language is 'life after life.' That is precisely what this cooperative represents for those of us who build it day by day. ","culture_historia.content_line3":"We are a company organized as a Worker Cooperative because we see association as a tool for life, and we are united by technological knowledge and practice. ","culture_historia.content_line4":"Ownership is collective, and thus we build agreements that shape our daily life, a living structure that allows us to innovate, experiment, and democratically choose what and how we produce. ","culture_historia.subtitle":"We work with production logics different from the conventional ones!

","culture_federales.content2":"We build and participate in various projects using Elixir and Rust, languages we specialize in to design concurrent, resilient, and high-performance systems. Our exploration has led us to delve into technologies like Blockchain and, increasingly, Artificial Intelligence, particularly through the implementation and use of Large Language Models (LLMs). ","culture_federales.title2":"Broad Exploration ","culture_federales.content3":"Our collective identity is shaped by the diversity of experiences we bring. We blend technology with music, engineering, cultural management, food sovereignty, outdoor sports, yoga, community radio, martial arts, and mutualism. We are defined by the different paths we’ve walked, the oscillation between our personal lives and joint projects. We see ourselves as friends. The synergy of working together allows us to have fun, plan goals, and tackle challenges as a team. We believe that creativity and technique feed off each other when working this way, with horizontal structures where ideas, responsibilities, and enthusiasm are shared. We value working with freedom and autonomy, deepening our commitment to every project we take on. ","culture_facttic.title":"Bridges to the Territory ","culture_facttic.subtitle":"We share knowledge through the Hackerspace ","culture_facttic.content_line1_part1":"We invest in our training, and at the same time, we dedicate energy to creating spaces where knowledge flows circularly with people and groups outside the cooperative, to break with the privatization of knowledge and contribute to ways of life that integrate technology without losing sight of autonomy and community relationships.

","culture_facttic.content_line2":"We believe the future is also a contested territory, and through our work, it’s possible to transmit alternative paradigms of work and culture.

","culture_internacional.title":"The Ecosystems We Are Part Of ","culture_internacional.content_line1":"We choose to be cooperatives, which strengthens ties not only territorially but also structurally toward building other possible economies. We are part of the Social and Solidarity Economy (ESS) movement, and sectorally, our work in the tech industry connects us to FACTTIC, the Argentine Federation of Worker Cooperatives in Technology, Innovation, and Knowledge. We are more than 40 grouped cooperatives, a space of construction that has been generating job opportunities, social projects, and mutual aid for over 10 years. ","culture_internacional.content_line2":"We see ourselves as territorial social actors, which is why those of us at Lawal are also involved in other social projects in Villa La Angostura. That’s how we support the development of Mutual La Correntosa, based on the organization of neighbors concerned with food sovereignty and dedicated to strengthening ties between consumers and family or cooperative agriculture producers. ","culture_internacional.content_line3":"Additionally, with an interest in Patagonia’s history—from its ancestral roots to the meanings we construct today—as well as in sustaining community cultural spaces, we connect with the Osvaldo Bayer Popular Library and participate in joint projects like Archivos del Sur. ","labs.title":"Experimental ","labs.subtitle":"At Lawal, we choose to use technology as a tool to explore our territory and our minds. ","labs.content":" We research and apply new technologies like Elixir, Rust, AI, and Blockchain. We also rely on principles and techniques of horizontal organization and broad participation. This way, we create programs, applications, experiences, and spaces that allow us to live lives with purposes beyond economic sustenance.
